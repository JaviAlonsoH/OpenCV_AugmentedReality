# OpenCV_AugmentedReality
Augmented Reality example in Python with the OpenCV library.

The reference image in this example is the cover of the Legion expansion of the famous game World of Warcraft.
You can replace the reference image with one of your choice. 

The video used is also a random cat vibing video. Again feel free to replace it in the root folder with anyone that you like.

The execution will fail if the camera doesn't recognise the reference image in the first place, so make sure camera is capturing in some way the reference image
you selected.

The final result shows 6 images, where included the camera image, the referenced image, the video, the matches between the referenced image and the image captured by the camera, the mask 
created from that recognition and the camera image mixed with the mask, which shows the actual result of the augmented reality.
